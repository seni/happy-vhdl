ANNOUNCING  Happy 1.10  - The LALR(1) Parser Generator for Haskell
-----------------------------------------------------------------

I'm pleased to announce version 1.10 of Happy, the parser generator
system for Haskell.  Changes in this version, relative to version 1.10
(the previous full release):

	* bugfixes, and minor performance improvements,

	* most of the examples work again.

Happy is available in source form, which can be compiled with GHC
version 4.xx (4.08 or 5.00 recommended), and we also provide binaries
for some architectures.  The Happy homepage with links to the various
distributions lives at:

	http://www.haskell.org/happy/

Please send any bug reports and comments to simonmar@microsoft.com.
